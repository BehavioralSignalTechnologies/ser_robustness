## ðŸ”Š Corruption Examples

We have created the [examples.ipynb](../src/noise_generation/examples.ipynb) notebook, in which we have used the different types of corruptions provided in this notebook, to produce the corrupted versions of the same audio file.



You can download the [examples.html](../src/noise_generation/examples.html) file to view the code and the produced audios.
